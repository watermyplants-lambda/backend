Will create better README monday. 

End points for register/login will be "/" gets all users, "/:id" get user by id, "/register" and "/login"
End points for plants will be "/" get all plants, "/:id" get plants by id.
Will provide more end points by sunday evening. 


Still need to create middleware and tokens but end points and server are working.
